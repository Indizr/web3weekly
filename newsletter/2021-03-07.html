        <p><strong>I'm starting a little experiment in transparency this week.</strong></p> 
        <p>Readers of the newsletter can now view a <a href="https://github.com/Indizr/web3weekly/commits/master">revision history</a> of the newsletter on GitHub. In essence, this will allow you to track my workflow as I add interesting links throughout the week, then write and edit the final version to send out.</p>
      <p>From the beginning, I've maintained a repository of all the newsletter's HTML on GitHub, mostly for use as a long-term archive. But I'm committing to using it more regularly throughout the week now as a drafting tool, so you can "watch" early drafts of the content if you wish. I'll include a link to this revision history each week from here out.</p>
      <p>This all revolves around an idea I've been toying with for a long time, to be honest. Back when I was a Wall Street Journal reporter in the aughts, I suggested to the our first social media coordinator for the newsroom that we should maintain and share publicly revision histories of our stories, Wikipedia style, to increase readers' trust in our work.</p>
      <p>People's trust in the press was already starting to wane in that era -- a trend that has only <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/waning-trust-and-a-perilous-financial-landscape-challenge-the-news-business">mushroomed</a> since. I figured additional transparency into our daily workflow might help to remedy the problem. However, word came back that this approach would make the higher-ups too antsy at the time.</p>
      <p>With the newsletter these days, I don't have that problem. ☺️ So why not give it a shot, finally? We'll see how it goes from here. <a href="mailto:peter@indizr.com">Let me know</a> what you think anytime.</p>
